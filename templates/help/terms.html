      <li>The Buyer's offer to purchase an App will not become binding upon a Seller until it is accepted by a Seller.  This includes any bids made by the Buyer in an Auction which must be accepted by the Seller for the bid to be valid.  </li>

      <ol>
        <li>the Default Sale Terms have merely been provided by AppsWalk to enable Sellers and Buyers to efficiently agree on the terms and conditions of the sale without resort to significant negotiation.  Consequently the Default Sale Terms may not be appropriate or suitable to the sale or purchase of any particular App;  </li>
        <li>you use the Default Sale Terms at your own risk and of your own choice.  There is no compulsion for you to use or agree to the Default Sale Terms; </li>
